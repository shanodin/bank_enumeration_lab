## Bank - Enumeration Lab

Make the tests for the Bank pass using **enumeration** methods.

You could use `forEach` as a replacement for `for` loops to solve all of these tasks.

However you may find that another, more specific enumeration method is better suited for each specific task.

The tests will ask you to make your bank able to:

- Find the total value of all accounts.
- Add 10% interest to the value of all accounts.
- Find the account with the largest value.
- Find the average value of all account.
